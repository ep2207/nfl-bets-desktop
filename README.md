Local tkinter Desktop App Setup
This section provides steps on how to set up and run a local tkinter based Python desktop app.

Prerequisites
Python: Ensure you have a compatible version of Python installed. tkinter is included in the standard library, so there's no need for additional installations for it.
Git: Ensure Git is installed on your computer to clone the repository.
Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone 'https://github.com/ep2207/nfl-bets-desktop'

Navigate to the Project Directory:

bash
Copy code
cd repository-name
Replace repository-name with the name of your project directory.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the App Locally: Depending on your main application file, run it using Python. If your main file is app.py, for instance, execute:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Troubleshooting
Dependency Issues: Ensure all required external libraries are listed in your requirements.txt file.
Python Version Issues: The application might require a specific Python version. Ensure you're using the appropriate version.
Conclusion
Now you have your tkinter desktop application set up locally. Enjoy using the app and making modifications as needed!

Remember to customize the guide based on the specific needs and structure of your tkinter project.
